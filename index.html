        <p>
            My name is Louis Daniel G. Moran, and I am a first-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I was born in February, and while I currently reside in Negros, my hometown is actually Rizal.

            I am an avid gamer, dedicating approximately six hours a day to competitive online gaming. My preferred titles include Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), League of Legends, Valorant, and Apex Legends. Although I cannot recall my most recent rank in CS:GO, I achieved a peak rank of Grandmaster in League of Legends, Diamond in Valorant, and Predator in Apex Legends.

            In addition to gaming, I am also a passionate reader. My favorite novels include "Shadow Slave," "Lord of the Mysteries," and "Mushoku Tensei." Currently, I am engrossed in "Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint." While I do not have a definitive top three for books, I thoroughly enjoyed reading "The Hunger Games" series up to "Mockingjay."

            Listening to music is another activity that helps me relax and think. My favorite artists include Zack Tabudlo, Cup of Joe, NIKI, and Adele.
